## Synopsis

Converts textareas to a CKEditor Rich Text Box

## Description

CKEditor is an update to the extension written by Jit and published [here](http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/31467/).

It converts textareas into CKEditor rich text boxes.

## Configuration options ##

### URL of CKEditor Script ###

This is the path to the CKEditor Script. If you put your /ckeditor folder in a non-standard location set this here. Otherwise the extension should detect this for you. 

### CKEditor Configuration ###

This provides site authors with the ability to add configuration options to CKEditor. Refer to [the documentation](http://docs.fckeditor.net/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide) for more information on configuration options

A simple example would be to set a Basic toolbar like this:

	CKEDITOR.replace(name,
    {
        toolbar : 'Basic'
    });

### When CKEditor loads ###

This sets when an CKEditor box is loaded. 

* On single click - the editor loads when there is a single click in a textarea
* On double click - the editor loads when there is a double click in a textarea
