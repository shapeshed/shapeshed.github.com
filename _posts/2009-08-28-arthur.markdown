## Compatibility

* Perl 5
* cURL support

## License

Arthur is free for personal and commercial use. 

If you use it for commercial use a donation of $25 is suggested. You can send [donations here](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/5855).

## Installation

You need Perl and the following modules:

* WWW::Curl::Easy;
* JSON;
* URI::Escape;

Open up bot.pl and enter your username and password and the search term you want to retweet.

You can either put Arthur.pm in a standard Perl modules folder or link to it in the bot.pl file with something like:

	use lib '/home/george/arthur/';
	
bot.pl needs to be executable and in a folder that it can write to. bot.pl writes a text file that stores the last tweet id so it knows where to retweet from the next time. 

## Name

## Synopsis

## Description


You can run Arthur from the command line like this:

	perl bot.pl

Or you can put it in a cron job like this:

	*/1 * * * * /home/george/bots/ee_bot/bot.pl > /dev/null
 
Arthur does not retweet retweets or retweet himself. That would lead to some kind of horrible infinite loop of retweets.
